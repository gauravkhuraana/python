Interface and abstract class are ways to achieve Abstraction in Java.

We can create an interface using “interface” keyword.
We can have abstract , default and static methods in an interface. From Java 8 , an interface can have concrete methods as well.
We can not instantiate an interface.
We can not create a constructor in an interface.
Data members in an Interface is public, static and final by default.
Abstract methods are public by default. A method without body will be abstract and public by default.
Multiple inheritance can be achieved using interface.
An interface can extend one or multiple interfaces.
An interface neither extend nor implement a class.
An interface can not have static or non-static blocks.
An interface without its implemented class is incomplete.


Different implementations were called but have similar type of interface reference

I1 ref1 = Class1.method1();
I1 ref2 = Class1.method2()

Return type may be an Interface type implementation class keeps the key.

obj.m1().m2().m3() <-- Method Chaining
